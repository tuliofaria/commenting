# Commenting system

This is a small commenting system where we can comment using different frontend solutions.

## Commitizen

This is a commitizen friendly repo. In order to commit, use:

## Folder and project structure

- `html-template`: this folder/project houses the initial HTML template draft. The goal is to extract some CSS values from the Figma design. Published at: [https://commenting-template.tuliofaria.dev/](https://commenting-template.tuliofaria.dev/)
- `frontend-v1`: first version of the frontend created using Vanilla Javascript. Published at: [https://commenting-frontend-v1.tuliofaria.dev/](https://commenting-frontend-v1.tuliofaria.dev). Copy one user id from the list of users, paste in the input field and click Signin.

## Sign-in:
In order to see the users available, you need to get this endpoint:

[https://commenting-test.herokuapp.com/users](https://commenting-test.herokuapp.com/users)

* Additionally, you can also create a new user with a POST request to the same endpoint, sending a json body with name.
